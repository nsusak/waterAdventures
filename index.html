        <hr>
        <p class="quote">I used to be so afraid of water up to the point I barely even took a shower once or twice in my
            life. But after these adventures I felt really alive! It made me want to spend some money on my water bills
            so I can recreate the adventure in my bathtub.</p>
        <p class="author">- Dirty John</p>
        <p class="quote">Horrible experience! We were convinced and dragged to the photo trip by our friend that made
            this page and we were too exhausted taking selfies. The beach was ok but we'll probably break our phones and
            live in a cave for the rest of our lives.</p>
        <p class="author">- Dunja & Hristo</p>
        <p class="quote">Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and
            you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose
            themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the
            cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
            Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.</p>
